# Estimation_Calculator
A calculator for gate estimation I built while working as a gate estimator.

The purpose of this calculator was to reduce the amount of time spent writing up an estimation, and to improve accuracy versus using excel spreadsheets.

This program was built as I was learning Python, so I began by writing my equations to run in Python only. My next step was to create a GUI to simplify the calculations and increase efficiency even more. I used the tkinter library to accomplish this task, adding tab controls in a notebook if ever I wanted to add more pages to my application. I also separated my pricing data into a second file to allow me to easily change the pricing of the commodities used for building gates (different sizes of tube steel, posts, concrete, labor, etc.).

After creating my calculator, I was able to accurately estimate any build in a fraction of the time it would take me to create a similar estimation using Excel, from approximately 15 minutes with Excel down to under 1 minute with my calculator. This is a 93% decrease in time spent building an estimate! It also reduced input errors in the process, as the calculator allowed me to interact with only a handful of variables instead of having to input every variable line by line in a spreadsheet. This created a reduction in time auditing the results for accuracy from up to an hour, to a few minutes--a time reduction of up to 95%.
